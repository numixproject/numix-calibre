# Numix Calibre

Effort to make an official Numix theme for Calibre to replace [the version that currently ships](https://www.deviantart.com/numixcalibre/art/Numix-theme-for-calibre-1-01-502183176) which violates the GPL. Thanks to [@leoheck](https://github.com/leoheck) for putting in the ground work and the [Papirus team](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam) whose [theme](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-calibre-theme) served as a development guide.


### Installing

At present the only way to install this version of the theme is to build it, though we're working on getting it into the official themes list.

1. Install the [Numix](https://github.com/numixproject/numix-icon-theme) base theme (doesn't matter how)
2.
